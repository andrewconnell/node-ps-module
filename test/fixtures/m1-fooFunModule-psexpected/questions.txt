Q) How is the CLR implemented?
* As a set of in-process DLLs loaded into the address space of processes that run managed code
- As an NT service hosts managed code running on each machine
- As a local COM server hosts managed code running on each machine
- As an XML web service

Q) What does a managed compiler produce as output?
* An assembly containing intermediate language (IL) and other metadata
- A native executable containing processor-specific instructions generated from IL
- A native dynamic link library containing processor-specific instructions generated from IL
- A native object code file containing processor-specific instructions generated from IL

Q) When does the JIT compiler convert the IL for a type's methods into processor-specific code?
- At runtime, when the assembly containing the type is loaded
- At runtime, when an instance of the type is allocated in the heap
* At runtime, on a method-by-method basis when the method is first invoked
- At build time, after the managed compiler produces the assembly containing the type

Q) The .NET Framework is a managed execution platform consisting of:
- An execution engine
* All of the these
- A set of class libraries
- A set of standards
